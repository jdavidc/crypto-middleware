# Crypto Price Proxy Middleware

A simple backend service built with **Spring Boot** that acts as a middleware (proxy) for fetching cryptocurrency prices from the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/).  
It provides a stable API for clients by caching data and handling rate limits gracefully.

## ‚ú® Features

- Fetches live prices for **Bitcoin** and **Ethereum** in USD.
- Uses **Caffeine Cache** to store the latest prices.
- Scheduled background refresh every 2 minutes.
- Serves cached data to avoid CoinGecko's `429 Too Many Requests` errors.
- REST endpoint ready to be consumed by web or mobile apps.
- Lightweight and deployable to free hosting platforms.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Java 21+**
- **Spring Boot 3**
- **Spring WebFlux** (WebClient)
- **Caffeine Cache**
- **Gradle**

## üì° API Endpoints

### Get current crypto prices
```http
GET /api/prices
#### Response example:
{
  "bitcoin": {
    "usd": 64235.12
  },
  "ethereum": {
    "usd": 3275.45
  }
}
```
If the CoinGecko API is unavailable or rate-limited, the service will return the last cached values.
